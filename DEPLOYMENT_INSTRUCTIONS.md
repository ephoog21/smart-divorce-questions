## 🔍 Monitoring Your Progress

### Check Database Growth
```sql
-- Connect to Railway PostgreSQL
-- Run these queries to monitor progress:

-- Total lawyers captured
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lawyers;

-- Lawyers by state
SELECT state, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM lawyers 
GROUP BY state 
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Most searched lawyers
SELECT name, search_count 
FROM lawyers 
ORDER BY search_count DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Target lawyers for outreach (new practices)
SELECT * FROM targetable_lawyers LIMIT 20;
```

### Analytics to Track
1. **Search Volume** - How many users search for lawyers
2. **Capture Rate** - Lawyers added per search
